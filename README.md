# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Mining
# Machine Learning & Data Mining with Python and Azure Machine Learning Studio
The purpose of this project is:
* To use machine learning and data mining techniques to analyse datasets and to draw conclusions based on the analysis, and finally to present the results in the form of a report.


### Technologies and Platforms Used
* Python
* Jupyther Notebook
* Microsoft Azure


## Tasks Performed
- Classification
- Association
- Clustering
- Text Mining
- Write up/reporting

## Dataset Description

The datasets used for Classification, Association and Clustering were downloaded from (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
The dataset used for Text mining was provided by the course provider. 


## Result of the Analysis
There were five files produced.

* Jupyther notebook: this contains Python code for KNN Classification. It is named `MLDM Task 1A (Classification - KNN_Heart_failure_clinical_records)`
* Jupyther notebook: this contains Python code for ANN Classification. It is named `MLDM Task 1A_Classification(ANN_Heart_failure_clinical_records)`
* Jupyther notebook: this contains Python code for Association. It is named `MLDM Task 2 (Association_rules - Androidpermissions dataset)`
* Jupyther notebook: this contains Python code for Clustering. It is named `MLDM Task 3_Clustering(Obesity dataset)`
* Jupyther notebook: this contains Python code for Clustering. It is named `MLDM Task 4_Text Mining(Tourist_accommodation_reviews_dataset)`
